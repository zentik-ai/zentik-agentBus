# AgentBus Skills

Cross-service planning skills for LLM coding agents.

This project removes the "developer as messenger" problem when understanding and planning features that touch multiple repos. Uses an **evidence-based workflow**: files are the source of truth.

## Core Principle: Evidence Over Communication

Instead of accumulating state in memory, AgentBus writes artifacts at each stage:

```
Wave 1:  Service Mapping      →  AGENTS.md (understand service)
Wave 2a: Plan Refinement      →  PLAN.md (plan the change)
Wave 2b: Context Queries      →  Answers from adjacent services
Wave 3:  Implementation       →  Code modified (no commits yet)
Wave 4:  Verification         →  TEST-RESULTS.md (verify it works)
Wave 4b: Adjustments (opt)   →  Minor fixes + clarifications
Wave 5:  Wrap-up (opt)       →  Git commits + deployment prep
```

Benefits:
- **Context efficiency**: Orchestrator reads only what it needs
- **Auditability**: Complete history in version-controlled files
- **Resumability**: Failed waves can be retried independently
- **Reusability**: AGENTS.md serves as ongoing service documentation

### Skill Hierarchy

| Skill | Role | Invocation |
|-------|------|------------|
| `agentbus` | Entry point / docs | `/agentbus` (information only) |
| `agentbus orchestrator` | Wave coordinator | `/agentbus orchestrator ...` |
| `agentbus service agent` | Service specialist | Via Task tool (internal) |
| `agentbus review` | Consistency checker | `/agentbus review ...` |

**Note**: Skill names use hyphens (not slashes) for compatibility with Cursor's skill system.

### Wave Summary

| Wave | Purpose | Key Output |
|------|---------|------------|
| 1 | Map services | `AGENTS.md` |
| 2a | Create plans | `PLAN.md` |
| 2b | Query adjacent services | Context answers |
| 3 | Implement changes | Modified code + `CHANGES.md` |
| 4 | Verify with tests | `TEST-RESULTS.md` |
| 4b | Adjust/fix minor issues | Updated code |
| 5 | Create commits | Git commits + `COMMITS.md` |

## Prerequisites

### 1. Load the AgentBus Skill (Required First Step)

Before using any AgentBus commands, **you must initialize the skill** so the LLM understands the system:

```
/agentbus
```

This loads the base skill which provides context about:
- The 7-wave execution model
- How to route to subskills (`agentbus orchestrator`, `agentbus review`)
- When to use AgentBus vs other skills

**Without this step, the LLM won't know how to use the orchestrator properly.**

### 2. Local Service Repositories (Required)

**All services you want to modify must be:**
- ✅ Cloned locally on your machine
- ✅ Inside your current working directory (workspace)
- ✅ Listed in `~/.agentbus/services.json` with correct paths

**Example:**
```
workspace/
├── exitus-agent-tools/     ← Local clone
├── exitus-bot-wa/          ← Local clone
└── agentbus-orchestrator/  ← Created by the tool
```

**The orchestrator cannot work with remote repositories** — it needs local access to read and modify files.

### 3. Service Registry Setup

## Service Registry

Global registry file: `~/.agentbus/services.json`

```json
{
  "payments-service": "/home/jero/repos/payments-service",
  "notifications-service": "/home/jero/repos/notifications-service"
}
```

**To register a service**: Read `~/.agentbus/services.json`, add entry, write back.

**To list services**: Read `~/.agentbus/services.json` and parse.

## Typical Flow

### Phase 1: Discovery (Optional)

Ask questions without writing files:

```bash
/agentbus-orchestrator --ask "how does onboarding work across services?" payments notifications
```

### Phase 2: Initialize Plan

Create seed plan with natural language (services detected automatically):

```bash
/agentbus-orchestrator "remove deprecated field from Tool model in tools and bot"
```

The orchestrator:
1. Detects services mentioned in your prompt ("tools" → exitus-agent-tools, "bot" → exitus-bot-wa)
2. Asks for confirmation of detected services
3. Validates plan numbering (scans `.agentbus-plans/` in each service, finds next sequential number)
4. Creates:
   - `agentbus-orchestrator/004-remove-field/status.json`
   - `agentbus-orchestrator/004-remove-field/SEED-PLAN.md`

**Fuzzy matching examples**:
- "bot de WA" → exitus-bot-wa
- "tools" → exitus-agent-tools  
- "api gateway" → exitus-api-gateway

### Phase 3: Wave 1 — Service Mapping

Run orchestrator again to start mapping:

```bash
# Reads status.json, launches parallel subagents
/agentbus-orchestrator --continue 001-remove-field
```

Each subagent writes:
- `{service}/AGENTS.md` (creates or updates)
- Summary JSON to orchestrator workspace

### Phase 4: Wave 2 — Plan Refinement

```bash
/agentbus-orchestrator --continue 001-remove-field
```

Each subagent:
- Reads `AGENTS.md` from its service
- Reads `SEED-PLAN.md`
- Writes refined `PLAN.md` to service repo

### Phase 5: Wave 3 — Implementation

⚠️ **Destructive** — Modifies source code (but doesn't commit yet)

```bash
/agentbus-orchestrator --continue 001-remove-field
```

Each subagent:
- Reads `PLAN.md` from its service
- Implements changes to source code
- Writes `CHANGES.md` with modified files

The orchestrator will ask for confirmation before proceeding.

### Phase 6: Wave 4 — Verification

```bash
/agentbus-orchestrator --continue 001-remove-field
```

Each subagent:
- Reads `CHANGES.md` from its service
- Runs tests
- Writes `TEST-RESULTS.md` with results

### Phase 7: Review

```bash
/agentbus-review --feature-slug "001-remove-field"
```

Reads all `TEST-RESULTS.md` files and checks:
- All services pass tests
- Dependencies are mirrored
- API contracts are consistent
- Deploy order is coherent

## How Verification Works

### Service-Level Verification (Wave 3 Subagent)

Each service subagent writes `REPORT.md` with:
- Verification status: ready / needs_work / blocked
- Implementation checklist
- Files to modify
- Local risks with mitigations
- Cross-service dependencies
- Open questions with owners

### Global Verification (Orchestrator + Review)

Orchestrator reads all `REPORT.md` and verifies:
- Plan completeness
- Dependency mirroring (A depends on B → B acknowledges A)
- Contract consistency
- Sequencing coherence
- Question ownership

## Adding Services Mid-Flight

1. Update `status.json` to add service
2. Re-run orchestrator for current wave
3. Only new service gets processed

## Retry Strategy

If a subagent fails:
1. Check `status.json` for error details
2. Fix underlying issue
3. Re-run orchestrator for that wave
4. Subagent overwrites its artifacts

## Notes

- **No helper scripts required** for core orchestration logic
- Skills use `Task` tool to spawn parallel subagents
- AGENTS.md persists as living service documentation
- Plans are kept in repos for visibility/auditability
- Current version favors simplicity over strong concurrency controls
